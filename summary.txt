#2: If msg.sender is different from tx.origin, am I protected ?
#3: can my contract be abused by being tricked to call (local or remote) methods where he's privileged ? (erc20 allowance for instance)
    calling calldata directly -> contract becomes a puppet
    instead, call a predefined named callback with defined prototype (the chainlink way, or even "unstoppable" way)
#4: You need to track user's debt when they borrow, not just the pool balance (maybe have signed balance to write down negative balance ?)
#5: Rewards should have been distributed _before_ minting accounting token for depositor. (inverse line 52 and 53 in rewarder contract)
#6: Such a drain method should be restricted to send fund to a trusted multisig address. Voting power should be averaged in a time window to avoid 1 block coups by flash loaners.
#7: ever heard of HSM ?
#8: Uniswap can be easily manipulated, it's not a reliable oracle "as is".
